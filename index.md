title: 'Zheng Xiong (熊铮)'

I am a DPhil student of [WhiRL](http://whirl.cs.ox.ac.uk/) at University of Oxford, advised by Prof. [Shimon Whiteson](http://whirl.cs.ox.ac.uk/pages/people/shimon.html). I’m also a member of [AIMS CDT](https://aims.robots.ox.ac.uk/).
I’m generally interested in improving the efficiency and generalization of
reinforcement learning (RL). Currently I mainly focus on meta-RL and multi-task RL
to achieve this goal, with application in domains such as robotic control and automated
algorithm design.

Previously, I graduated from Tsinghua University with Bachelor in Electronic Engineering and Master in Computer Science, working on automated machine learning with Prof. [Wenwu Zhu](https://www.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/info/1116/3529.htm).
